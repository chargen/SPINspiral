  Please log changes here (and add a short comment using svn commit -m 'Comment').

     - many of the variables used in mcmc() are now in the struct mcmcvariables.
       This should make it easier to restructure mcmc() and stick more of its code
       into subroutines.
    
    16: sluys
     - the mcmc.input was changed: a manual T ladder can now be given as input.
    
    15: sluys
     - the mcmc.input was changed: parameter selectdata added, to allow selection 
       of a noise data set.  Selectdata=0 shows a list of data sets available.
    
    11: sluys
     - removing plot code from this svn, will create a new one for that, moving 
       files around.
     
     7: sluys
     - the code now takes 1 command-line argument: the input filename (mcmc.input 
       if none given)
     - all 'true' values are now in the input file. Use these to inject a signal 
       and/or to determine the initial parameters of the MCMC.  *NOTE* that these 
       parameters are not the same parameters/units as the MCMC parameters!
     - the struct runpar is setup, which is supposed to contain all 'run parameters' 
       (from the input file). More variables must be added later and the struct must
       be passed throughout much of the code.
     - the global variable datadir has moved from mcmc.input to the new input file
       mcmc.local, because it is system dependent.
     
     
     6: sluys
     - removed bug with 'inject' parameter, 'inject' is in input file now.
     
     
     4: sluys
     - added directory plot_code containing plot programs plotspins.f, plotsignal.f.
     
     
     1: sluys
     Initial import of mcmc code, adapted from spinning_13.c.  Main changes:
     - code split up into several files
     - cleaned up unused routines (mcmc routine still needs rearranging)
     - more comments in the code
     - use of an input file (mcmc.input).  This file is read by readinputfile()
       and a copy of it is written by writeinputfile(). Please keep the two in sync
       (this may be used later to start a new run from the end of an old one).
     - header files are in ./include/, my libFrame is in ~/bin/lib/, so change this in 
       your Makefile
