   134: sluys, 20/02/2009
     - implemented part of the functionality of the mcmc.parameters input file
       - prior routines are now waveform-independent, much smaller and moved back 
         to mcmc_mcmc.c	
       - I removed mcmc_prior.c, because it was empty
       - prior information can be set in the mcmc.parameters input file
     
   133: sluys, 20/02/2009
     - finished injection routines; software injections can be done 
       using mcmc.injection, either using the values specified, or
       using random values (from Gaussian or uniform distributions)
   
   132: sluys, 20/02/2009
     - moved offset chain info from mcmc.mcmc to mcmc.parameters; 
       the format of both files was changed
     
   131: sluys, 20/02/2009
     - new input file mcmc.injection (see doc/)
     - injection data removed from mcmc.input
     - format of mcmc.mcmc changed
   
   126: sluys, 18/02/2009
     - global variable npar was replaced by nMCMCpar and nInjectPar,
       in the structs runpar and mcmcvariables
     
   123: sluys, 18/02/2009
     - new version of input file mcmc.mcmc needed (see doc/)
     
   121: sluys, 18/02/2009
     - new version of input file mcmc.parameters needed (see doc/)
   
   118: sluys, 13/02/2009
     - new input file mcmc.parameters (see doc/):
       - contains data on how to treat MCMC parameters
       - file read, but data not yet used
     - tukeywin now read from mcmc.data
   
   114: sluys, 06/02/2009
     - input files changed, see in doc/: mcmc.input, mcmc.mcmc, mcmc.data
     - created new input file mcmc.mcmc with all data on how to do mcmc
     - moved most data from mcmc.input to mcmc.mcmc and mcmc.data
     
   111: sluys, 05/02/2009
     - input file mcmc.data changed, see doc/mcmc.data_NINJA_noise
     - added parameters PSDsegmentNumber and PSDsegmentLength to runpar struct and mcmc.data
     
   110: sluys, 04/02/2009
     - replaced waveformversion with mcmcWaveform and injectionWaveform in the run and 
       mcmc structs.  For now only the first is read and the second is set equal to the first.
     - made mcmc.input compatible with up to 20 parameters
     - shrunk the screen output a bit to fit 15 parameters in one line
   
   104: sluys, 30/01/2009
     - copied the n-parameter branch into the trunk
     
    94: sluys, 07/01/2009
     - map 0.25<eta<0.50 to 0.5-eta consistently in template12()
    
    93: sluys, 06/01/2009
     - allow for 0.25<eta<0.50 in template12() (Apostolatos)
    
    85: sluys, 08/12/2008
     - set tukeywin to 0.15
    
    83: sluys, 05/12/2008
     - Fixed bug: ifo[2].noisedoubleprecision was ifo[2].noisedoubleprecision 
       for data set 1 in mcmc_data.c
     - Added a new input file: mcmc.data (name specified in mcmc.input, 
       set selectdata=0 to use it).  See doc/mcmc.data for an example.
     - The parameter selectifos in mcmc.input selects the IFOs for the network
        
    65: sluys, 22/10/2008
     - Added possibility to start chains from specified values (new values for offsetmcmc)
       The input file has now one extra line 'starting values' below 'injection values'
     - The original (buggy?) dataset is back as #6 (for comparison with earlier results)
     - Some cleaning, parameters -> structs
    
    53: sluys, 06/08/2008
     - Replaced LALinterface.c with mcmc_lal.c: this contains all of LALinterface
       plus template15().  LAL-dependent stuff was moved from mcmc.h to the new
       file mcmc_lal.h.  A file mcmc_nolal.c was added to allow LALless compilation.
        
    48: sluys, 07/07/2008
     - Made some small changes (cleaning?) to the 15-waveform routines to see if 
       it changes anything
     
    47: sluys, 25/06/2008
     - Added routines to compute overlap, match and Fisher matrix to mcmc_signal
     - Cleaned up template12() and localpar() in mcmc_templates
     - Renamed this file to more default ChangeLog.txt
         
    46: sluys, 07/06/2008
     - Changed name and contents of *PSD.dat:
       - signalPSD.dat and dataPSD.dat have PSD replaced by FFT
       - these files contain real and imaginary parts of the amplitude spectrum
       - noisePSD.dat is now noiseASD.dat, because in contains the amplitudes
       - to get compatible amplitudes, all values are a factor sqrt(2) higher
       - all output is no longer logged (incl. f)
    
    41: sluys, 19/05/2008
     - Made waveform_main uptodate
       
    37: sluys, 16/05/2008
     - Merging 3.5PN code into svn, step 2
     - Old 1.5PN is used, references to 3.5PN commented out for now
     
    36: vivien, 16/05/2008
     - Merging 3.5PN code into svn, step 1	
     
    35: sluys, 13/05/2008
     - I changed the boundaries for \eta in the previous commit, changed them back
       since chains get stuck at very low \eta and very high L	 
     - Fixed two small memory leaks
    
    34: sluys, 09/05/2008
     - The input parameter saveallchains was renamed to savehotchains. If 0 (save
       T=1 chain only) or 1 (save all parallel chains) the effect is the same as
       before. However, savehotchains=n saves 1 in every n states for the T>1 chains
       for each T=1 state (i.e. extra thinning for the hotter chains)
     - The boundary conditions in prior() changed: only one 'bounce off the wall' is
       allowed, if the parameter is then not between the BCs, prior = 0
     - Output file is no longer opened for every saved state (as it was since the split)
     - Added and changed comments in mcmc_data and mcmc_signal, try to make code more
       readable
       
    33: sluys, 30/04/2008
     - THE MCMC	OUTPUT FORMAT HAS CHANGED:
       - The columns 'acceptance rate' and 'sigma' have disappeared from the output file
       - The other columns have fewer decimals
       - The size of the output file is reduced with a factor of ~2.5!
       - The columns of the screen output have fewer decimals, a reduction of ~28%
       - Switch back to the old output by setting useoldmcmcoutputformat=1 in main()
    
    32: sluys, 30/04/2008
     - The input file has changed:
       - RA is now given in stead of 'longi'
       - setranpar[12] and ranparseed were added to inject random parameters
       - notice that setranpar uses M1,M2 in stead of Mc,eta!
     - Many small other (often cosmetic) changes, most notably:
       - the 'header' that provides signal info to screen in now in main(), not mcmc()
       - some local source info for each detector is provided
    
    30: sluys, 16/04/2008
     - Vivien found an error in calculating h_x: L.N should be used, not (L.N)^2
     - Some lines were missing that are needed to include Virgo data
    
    29: sluys, 15/04/2008
     - Vivien found a bug in the 1.5PN waveform template, in creating the vectors N^ 
       and J^.  The latter was more serious, since the angle theta_J0 was used later
       in the template in a different way, creating an inconsistent use of this angle.	
       Now, this angle should be a latitude (rather than colatitude, as in the 
       Apostolatos paper, which it must be if we keep sin(theta_J0) as an MCMC parameter.
    
    28: sluys, 16/03/2008
     - Input file changed, 2 parameters added:
       - networksize: number of IFOs in the network (1-3): 1: H1, 2: H1L1, 3: H1L1V
       - targetsnr: Total network SNR that the signal should have: obtained by scaling 
         the distance (and thus the true distance of the injected signal is changed!).
    
    23-27: sluys, 05-10/03/2008
     - Bugfixes
    
    22: sluys, 05/03/2008
     - Input file changed, 2 parameters added:
       - corrfrac sets the fraction of all MCMC updates that uses the correlations
       - mataccfr sets the fraction of (fitted) mcmc parameters that must improve 
         in order to accept a new matrix. See description in mcmc.input.
     - Every so often an extra-large jump is proposed:
       - every 1e3 or 1e4 iterations, a 10x or 100x larger jump respectively is 
         proposed in all parameters,
       - every 1e2 or 1e3 iterations, a 10x or 100x larger jump respectively is 
         proposed for a single parameter.
    
    21: sluys
     - more of mcmc() splitted off: update_covariance_matrix() does what it says,
       anneal_temperature() takes care of annealing, swap_chains() does so for the
       parallel-tempering chains and write_chain_info() writes info on the chains and
       parallel-tempering chains to screen.  mcmc() is now 415 lines.
    
    19: sluys
     - more of mcmc() splitted off:  write_mcmc_header() writes the first bit of
       output to screen and file, allocate_mcmcvariables() and free_mcmcvariables()
       (de)allocate memory for the mcmcvariables struct. MCMC() is now ~690 lines.
    
    18: sluys
     - parts of the mcmc routine were splitted off into different, new subroutines: 
       correlated_mcmc_update(), uncorrelated_mcmc_single_update() and
       uncorrelated_mcmc_block_update() now take care of MCMC updates.  The routine
       write_mcmc_output() writes output to screen and file.  Mcmc() is now ~830 
       lines.
    
    17: sluys
     - many of the variables used in mcmc() are now in the struct mcmcvariables.
       This should make it easier to restructure mcmc() (now ~1000 lines) and stick 
       more of its code into subroutines.
    
    16: sluys
     - the mcmc.input was changed: a manual T ladder can now be given as input.
    
    15: sluys
     - the mcmc.input was changed: parameter selectdata added, to allow selection 
       of a noise data set.  Selectdata=0 shows a list of data sets available.
    
    11: sluys
     - removing plot code from this svn, will create a new one for that, moving 
       files around.
     
     7: sluys
     - the code now takes 1 command-line argument: the input filename (mcmc.input 
       if none given)
     - all 'true' values are now in the input file. Use these to inject a signal 
       and/or to determine the initial parameters of the MCMC.  *NOTE* that these 
       parameters are not the same parameters/units as the MCMC parameters!
     - the struct runpar is setup, which is supposed to contain all 'run parameters' 
       (from the input file). More variables must be added later and the struct must
       be passed throughout much of the code.
     - the global variable datadir has moved from mcmc.input to the new input file
       mcmc.local, because it is system dependent.
     
     
     6: sluys
     - removed bug with 'inject' parameter, 'inject' is in input file now.
     
     
     4: sluys
     - added directory plot_code containing plot programs plotspins.f, plotsignal.f.
     
     
     1: sluys
     Initial import of mcmc code, adapted from spinning_13.c.  Main changes:
     - code split up into several files
     - cleaned up unused routines (mcmc routine still needs rearranging)
     - more comments in the code
     - use of an input file (mcmc.input).  This file is read by readinputfile()
       and a copy of it is written by writeinputfile(). Please keep the two in sync
       (this may be used later to start a new run from the end of an old one).
     - header files are in ./include/, my libFrame is in ~/bin/lib/, so change this in 
       your Makefile
