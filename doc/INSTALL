SPINspiral INSTALL


You will need CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is open-source
software, and can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/.


To compile the code, from the main package directory (the one that contains 
the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make install


To force CMake to compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line 
   with e.g. FC=clang:

 $ FC=clang cmake ..
