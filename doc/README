SPINspiral README


The SPINspiral package provides a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo code to do parameter
estimation on LIGO/Virgo data that contain a binary-inspiral signal.
The program needs to be linked against the gsl, fftw3 and LALSuite 
(https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/lalsuite.html; in particular
LAL, LALFrame, LALMetaio, and LALInspiral) libraries.  For compilation
you can use CMake (available at http://www.cmake.org/).  To download SPINspiral, 
read the code documentation, or to contact the developers, see: 
http://spinspiral.sourceforge.net/



INSTALLATION:

For installation instructions, see doc/INSTALL.
